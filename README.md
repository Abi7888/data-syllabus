# Data Science Syllabus and Benchmarks
**Documented below are various articles, tutorials, books, videos, and online courses related to practical data science.**

&nbsp;

**Background:** In the fall of 2015, I attended [a free event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crowdfunding-decoded-find-your-early-adopters-and-launch-products-tickets-18339325416?aff=ebapi) at the Seattle Galvanize campus. The presentation itself was fascinating, but it also happened to be my first encounter with a coding bootcamp. Previously I heard of such things through stories about how regulations in California [were potentially stifling them](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140130/11104326050/apparently-you-cant-teach-someone-to-code-california-without-license.shtml), but I had no idea how effective they would become as a college alternative...

I already had plans on taking some courses from Udacity (particularly the [Data Analyst track](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), among [other things](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)), and Codecademy had already turned out to be a useful resource as well. So I decided to give coding bootcamps a shot as a more efficient way of both acquiring industry-relevant skills, as well as signal to potential employers what I am capable of doing.

In the spring of 2016, I attended a part-time data science course at General Assembly. I literally learned more in ten weeks from that course than I did in *general* from 18 months of being enrolled at a community college. My capstone from that course [can be found here](https://github.com/analyticascent/stylext). For over a year now I have anticipated taking the three-month immersive at Galvanize as a final stepping stone to full time work. But any endeavor this intense warrants some early training beforehand.

This is my attempt at putting that training syllabus together.

## 0. Online Prep

These are sites with courses I have either already used or plan to use. I chose Codecademy and Datacamp because they take a more modular approach to how you learn a given topic - that is, you can stick to something specific rather than having to take an entire course track for the tidbits you actually need.

&nbsp;

#### A. Life is Study:

Somehow when doing a web search for information related to Ipython or Pandas or something along those lines, I came across [this blog series](http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/12/python-for-data-analysis-index.html). As anyone can tell just from the index alone, that series has a very good overview of some fundamental concepts. Not only that, but some of the specific techniques differ enough from the General Assembly Ipython lessons to make it work doing them all.

30. [Random Forests](http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/12/python-for-data-analysis-part-30-random.html)

Realistically, I think a section a day is a sensible goal. The more sophisticated sections will likely be things I repeat until I can code them from scratch (assuming I have a list of the procedural steps I need code for). This is the same approach I intend to take when reviewing my General Assembly lessons.

&nbsp;

#### B. General Assembly:

I should say early on that this is a course I already took. I just want to review the lessons again and fork each of the Ipython notebooks into different use cases.

Each lesson has both slides, and an Ipython notebook (or two) to go over. **One of the biggest mistakes I made during the [part-time course](https://ga.co/ds) was that I got in the habit of just executing the existing lesson code during class without actually taking the time to understand line-by-line what it was there for.** This time I plan on understanding everything line by line and making my own variants that include additional markdown documentation about what you should know about each of the python cells. Additionally, I plan on getting familiar enough with the procedural steps the notebooks take to the point where I can code them from scratch.

&nbsp;

#### C. Datacamp Courses:

1. [Introduction to R](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

2. [Intro to Statistics with R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-statistics-with-r-introduction)

3. [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

4. [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science)

5. [Importing Data in Python Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1)

6. [Importing Data in Python Part 2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-2)

7. [Introduction to Relational Databases in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-relational-databases-in-python)

8. [Interactice Data Visualization with Bokeh](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-data-visualization-with-bokeh)

9. [Statistical Thinking in Python Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1)

Most of these take *four hours or less* to do according to the descriptions. I might try to do them all in one week.

&nbsp;

#### D. Codecademy Courses:

1. [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

2. [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)

3. [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)

4. [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)

5. [SQL: Analyzing Business Metrics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/sql-analyzing-business-metrics)

6. [SQL: Table Transformation](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/sql-table-transformation)

7. [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)

8. [Learn Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)

Learn the Command Line and Learn Git can be done in a day if I really wanted to. I might just repeat those from time to time. All the others on the list might take days to do, but Codecademy no longer lists hourly estimates. 

&nbsp;

#### E. Data Science Primer:

&nbsp;

## 1. Reading List

List first is the title, followed by subject matter, page count, and chapter count. Chapter count is significant because I intend to read at least two chapters from this list per day, if not more. In a matter of months, I should be familiar with the weekly content in [Galvanize's 12-week Immersive](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/) course.
