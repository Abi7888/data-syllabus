# Data Science Syllabus and Benchmarks
**Documented below are various articles, tutorials, books, videos, and online courses related to practical data science.**

**Background:** In the fall of 2015, I attended [a free event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crowdfunding-decoded-find-your-early-adopters-and-launch-products-tickets-18339325416?aff=ebapi) at the Seattle Galvanize campus. The presentation itself was fascinating, but it also happened to be my first encounter with a coding bootcamp. Previously I heard of such things through stories about how regulations in California [were potentially stifling them](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140130/11104326050/apparently-you-cant-teach-someone-to-code-california-without-license.shtml), but I had no idea how effective they would become as a college alternative...

I already had plans on taking some courses from Udacity (particularly the [Data Analyst track](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), among [other things](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)), and Codecademy had already turned out to be a useful resource as well. So I decided to give coding bootcamps a shot as a more efficient way of both acquiring industry-relevant skills, as well as signal to potential employers what I am capable of doing.

In the spring of 2016, I attended a part-time data science course at General Assembly. I literally learned more in ten weeks from that course than I did in *general* from 18 months of being enrolled at a community college. My capstone from that course [can be found here](https://github.com/analyticascent/stylext). For over a year now I have anticipated taking the three-month immersive at Galvanize as a final stepping stone to full time work. But any endeavor this intense warrants some early training beforehand.

This is my attempt at putting that training syllabus together.
